        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>
            Venice, known also as the “City of Canals,” “The Floating City,” and “Serenissima,” is arguably one of Italy’s most picturesque cities. With its winding canals, striking architecture, and beautiful bridges, Venice is a popular destination for travel. The best way to arrive in Venice is by train, to the Santa Lucia Train Station on the northwestern edge of the city. There's also a bus terminal and parking garages nearby, at Piazzale Roma. Venice also has the small Marco Polo Venice Airport, and from there, you can take a bus or boat into Venice

        <h2>Discussion of the Place</h2>
        <p>
            The specified place mentioned that there are charming canals, pedestrian-friendly space and impressive art and architecture all add to its unique appeal. Yet with soaring visitor numbers, Venice overtourism is becoming an ever more important issue. In 2017 the local tourist board recently introduced '12 good rules for the responsible visitor' in a bid to promote sustainable tourism. Rules include not standing on the bridges, not leaving 'love padlocks' and trying to visit outside of high season. It's certainly a step in the right direction. But to really give Venice's structure (and locals) a break, consider a trip to Annecy, France, instead.

        <h2>Other places to visit in that country (Rome)</h2>
        <p>Rome is a city built on layers with a cascading ivy wrapped around with ancient columns, ruins that are incorporated or improved into modern structures, piazzas filled including remnants of a few thousandy year-old temples that are built back thousands of years. Aside from this, Rome is filled with visual records of its diverse time periods, and its an incredible sight to behold considering it is an ancient city but integrated and improved in order to provide habitat resulting in the present city, not missing any experience of its history at every details in its structures.</p>
