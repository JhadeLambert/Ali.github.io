        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>
            According to<a target="winImage" href="https://www.pygmy-elephant.com/blog/the-history-of-torres-del-paine-park-the-crown-jewel-of-chilean-patagonia">pygmy-elephant,</a>Patagonia is famous for housing a great variety of wildlife, unspoiled nature and ancient indian cultures. Archaeological findings date back to 8,000 B.C., from Pre-Columbian civilizations to the skilled Mapuche indians known for mastery in weapons making and agriculture of the 16th century.  But Patagonia is not only an open air archaeological gallery, it also bears the Andes mountains, one of the longest rock formations on Earth and, amid  it, the famous touristic destination and trekking paradise of Torres del Paine National Park in the Cordillera del Paine mountain chain.

        <h2>Discussion of the Place</h2>
        <p>
            The site describes the place where raising among turquoise lakes, rapids, waterfalls and flatlands, lie these massive granite and stark sedimentary rock protuberances, which were formed back in the Cretaceous period when dinosaurs still wandered on our planet. A good example of this erosion is the Cuernos del Paine, whose central bands of exposed granite contrast strongly with the dark aspect of their tops, which are remnants of a heavily eroded sedimentary stratum. In the case of Las Torres, what once was their overlying sedimentary rock layers have been completely eroded away, leaving behind the more resistant granite.

        <h2>How to get there</h2>
        <p>
            There are no direct flights to Punta Arenas which is near the specified place and the fastest way to get to Torres del Paine National Park is taking a plane from Argentina's capital to the city of El Calafate and then move by bus or rental car to Puerto Natales, around three hundred kilometers journey that may take 4 to 5 hours possibly.

        <h2>Other places to visit in that country (Dientes De Navarino)</h2>
        <p>Located below the Southern Cone which is on the other side of Magellan, is the large island of Tierra del Fuego and is shared by Chile and Argentina. Suitable for hiking due to its trek cuts accompanied by a jagged mountain range with a striking silhouette shadows of the mountains sharply rising from the ground. </p>
