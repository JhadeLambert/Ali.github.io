			The movies piqued my interest as soon as I watch the “Avengers Assemble” then followed by other movies such as the “Age of Ultron” and soon had high expectations to the “Infinity War” and Endgame. I further researched the movies and watch a story containing each member from the Avengers such as “Iron Man” and “Captain America: The First Avenger”. The plot was interesting even though the order of time of the movies were different. I still had time to figure out the timeline of each movie. The video provided contains a clip of compilation from what I’ve watched from the MCU.

			The mentioned anime series is the start of my interest in watching other series such as “Attack on Titan” and “My Hero Academia.”. Naruto is the source of my addiction in watching anime. To see a protagonist, achieve their goals and the obstacles that they encounter were motivating to my life. There are other shows that provides entertainment but there are series that I favor and may even influence me to do something productive. The series is about Naruto who is a ninja who wants to be a Hokage which is a leader in a village. The video embedded shows to the character I mentioned that shows 2 sides of the series of his age from where he started and where he is now.
