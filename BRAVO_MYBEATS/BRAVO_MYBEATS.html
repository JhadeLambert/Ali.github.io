			<h3>Acoustic, Folk, Country, Classical</h3>
			<p>
				The mentioned genres of music are what helped me during my studies 
				and programming even today. Distractions in my environment are not that rare and 
				there are a lot of people of in the house which is noise is considered unavoidable. 
				I put on a headset/earphones and if possible, go to the bedroom where noises are low. 
				In addition to this, I listen to classical or acoustic instrumental music during lessons.
				It helps me motivate to listen and prevent of boredom because I want to learn what is
				taught from my teachers and professors. Here are a sample of music that I am currently
				listening to.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ed sheeran is one of the first artist that I listen too. He is also one of the reason for 
				learning a guitar. He began playing guitar at a young age and soon after started writing 
				his own songs. A part of me wants to be like him but there are other goals that I need to prioritize
				which concludes my hobby in playing guitar as a hooby only.

				Pachelbel was a german composer. I was captivated by one of his piece that is still covered in Youtube either 
				acoustic or a rock version. Some even made a remix and other popular songs accompanied by the melodies from the piece are inspired from it.

			<h3>Rock, Pop</h3>
			<p>
				This type of genres is what I listen to during my free time, housework as well as sleeping. 
				During breaks from my online class I often sat to my bed and listen to some songs, it helps 
				my mood and avoid thinking negative thoughts. Housework is an everyday task that is very 
				frustrating thing to do thus accompanying it with music makes it more motivating and prevent 
				any frustrations from doing so. Here are my favorite music that makes me sleep and motivate me 
				in household chores. 
			</p>

			<p>
				There are other songs from SIT(Set IT Off) that I listen to. The band mainly consists of frontman vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Cody Carson, guitarist Zach DeWall, and drummer Maxx Danziger. It is also supported by
				a their fans called "freaks". One of their most noted albums called "Upside Down" takes a brighter sound than previous releases and offers the band's most pop-driven genre band.
			</p>

			<p>
				Fall Out Boy was also a rock band where it consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. Their albums and songs mainly provides me motivation to certain tasks and chores.
