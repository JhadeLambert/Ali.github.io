			<p>Before the pandemic, my family would often go to events that relates to family or meeting with other relatives. We sometimes visit my grandparents
			each semester break which is located in a province</p>

		<h2>Circle of Friends</h2>
			<p>Aside from my family, I socialize and make new friends as I pass through from elementary to college. Interactions that relates to my activities or hobbies are often associated with my friends. We help and support each other in classrooms, assignments and even life advices. I don't depend on all of them but there company is always appreciated.</p>

		<h2>Profile Pictures / Stolen Shots</h2>
			<p>Taking a picture of myself is never my strong skill. I would delete them due to my negative thoughts about it and accept
			those thoughts as a fact but there are other people who would say otherwise. They would often take pictures of me unpermitted but I often do the same.
			The displayed picture below are a compilation of pictures of myself taken by my friends which are acceptable due to its quality and angle. </p>
