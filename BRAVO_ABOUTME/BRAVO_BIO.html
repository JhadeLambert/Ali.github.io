    		<sup>1</sup>I was young with a few friends that can almost go and run anywhere. 
    		<sup>2</sup>We mostly play tag and any kind of energetic games that starts from morning till evening. 
    		<sup>3</sup>We would buy drinks and sometimes go to some of their houses to replenish some energy. 
    		<sup>4</sup>Whenever some of us can’t due to sickness, we would come to their place for a visit and often play stationary types. 
    		<sup>5</sup>Aside from this, my siblings would often play pranks on me. 
    		<sup>6</sup>They would hide and sometimes disappear in a short period of time and would pop out of nowhere to scare me. 
    		<sup>7</sup>My brother and I would go to computer shops and 1v1 and coop to Crossfire and DOTA 1. 
    		<sup>8</sup>In addition to this, we would play chess with a few conditions from the loser side and of course I would lose often as I was not aware of any strategies let alone a move from each piece would go but I still had fun then.
    		<sup>9</sup>My sisters often teach me some lessons I’d learn when I was in kindergarten. 
    		<sup>10</sup>I would often escape until they would lock the gate and keys would be in their hands. 
    		<sup>11</sup>Either way, learning academics was not my strongest feature. 
    		<sup>12</sup>As my I graduate from kinder and started elementary, I would often catch as being noisy during classes. 
    		<sup>13</sup>Since my attention span was as short as my height unless it was a subject in my interest, I would often talk to my classmates about games and TV shows. 
    		<sup>14</sup>My grades where passing but not pleasing to the eyes of my parents. 
    		<sup>15</sup>Since then, my parents would check my notebook to see any topics and lecture me some points about it. 
    		<sup>16</sup>It did not improve my intelligence whatsoever but became aware of the importance the grades.
    		<sup>17</sup>I was still learning and barely pass the subjects as I graduated elementary. 
    		<sup>18</sup>The high school that my parents chose were the same as my brother and sister go to but they already graduated high school.
    		<sup>19</sup>My childhood continues but became to be cautious of my grades as my parents taught me. 
    		<sup>20</sup>Aside from this, I still prioritize having fun and making friends that would help me to do them.

			<sup>1</sup>My grades were not improving and because of this, My parents warned me.
    		<sup>2</sup>Punishments are necessary in order to learn from mistakes and since then, I begin to learn and would study for their sake and for mine as well. 
    		<sup>3</sup>As I continue, I became interested in learning to play a guitar. 
    		<sup>4</sup>My friend would teach me some chords and borrow his guitar just to experience using one. 
    		<sup>5</sup>As time pass, my sister bought me my own guitar on my birthday. 
    		<sup>6</sup>My fingers were sore but still play as there are improvements showing. 
    		<sup>7</sup>My friends and I would jam as each recess or break time occur. 
    		<sup>8</sup>We would also practice dancing for a certain group presentation in our subject
    		<sup>9</sup>Even in the Christmas party, the whole class must perform their certain talents. 
    		<sup>10</sup>The term “issue” didn’t apply to me but since there certain times I would approach a girl which is my friend in my class, my classmates would tease me assuming we were couples or something. 
    		<sup>11</sup>I was annoyed and they didn’t even believe me as if it is were some excuse because I was shy.
    		<sup>12</sup>Regardless the girl I always approach lessened. 
    		<sup>13</sup>During my class, I college student introduced us K-12 by which adding 2 more years with a course/strand we would choose.
    		<sup>14</sup>I chose General academics and never regretted choosing it due to meeting some friends that I am glad to have.
    		<sup>15</sup>We would study and sometimes hangout to places we need to go. 
    		<sup>16</sup>Each collaborative event we need to do are fun as there were various subject that I learned.
    		<sup>17</sup>But since then, I was introduced to course that introduces computers and programming. 
    		<sup>18</sup>I’ve liked the subject and decided to pursue the course in my college.
    		<sup>19</sup>Sadly, I did not pass the entrance exam to the current college I was in and would seem to be separate to my precious friends as I pick the ones I passed.
    		<sup>20</sup>We promised to hangout even when in different colleges.

	<p class="COL">

			<img src="../media/images/col.jpg" alt="College Picture" title="College Picture"></a>
    		<sup>1</sup>I became friends with a few classmates. 
    		<sup>2</sup>We learned and discuss to each other about our futures and subjects about our teachers. 
    		<sup>3</sup>We would talk about topics unrelated to our class and share a few interesting experiences. 
    		<sup>5</sup>Mischievous pranks would often occur to some which includes in our game of cards (UNO) and chess. 
    		<sup>5</sup>We would often declare dares to the one who lost and do those dares in one class to another. 
   			<sup>6</sup>Aside from this, we attended a basketball match as requirement for our PE class where our school’s team versus the other universities team. 
    		<sup>7</sup>Expecting from the past matches of our school’s team, we would anticipate ours would lose. 
    		<sup>8</sup>But a miracle occurs, a tie score between them and the time as reaching its end
    		<sup>9</sup>We shouted and cheered to the team and would joke to hide our red colored t shirts that symbolizes our university to the opposing one. 
    		<sup>10</sup>The match ended where our university won as we drained our vocals. 
    		<sup>11</sup>Before Covid 19, My senior high school friends and I planned out an overnight. 
    		<sup>12</sup>Me and my other friend were late because we had assignments and class that we had finished in short amount of time. 
    		<sup>13</sup>We met with the others with a few updates and experiences that we shared until night. 
    		<sup>14</sup>We drank a few as we watched horror movies but a few already were asleep. 
    		<sup>15</sup>We would picture their faces and send them to our group chat for the memories but regrettable for them.
    		<sup>16</sup>During the quarantine today we would only chat and call each other from time to time.
    		<sup>17</sup>They would plan vacations, outings as soon as the quarantine ended. 
    		<sup>18</sup>We would sometimes help each other in our assignments even if we were separate schools.
    		<sup>19</sup>I sometimes play some online games with them during our free time until today.
    		<sup>20</sup>Up until now we would talk and share about our lives and same as the others, I missed them and hoped that 
		we would meet each other personally again.
